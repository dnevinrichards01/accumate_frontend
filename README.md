## Original Buul website (React + Vite)
*For details and a tutorial, visit [Buul's backend repo](https://github.com/dnevinrichards01/buul_backend/tree/try_it_out_local) which is serving as the Buul project's 'hub'.*

### Description
This is my first ground-up React project. It features:
1. an interactive graph
2. the ability to add your email to a waitlist on the backend
    - (won't work because the backend has been shut down) 

It is no longer being maintained so ***formatting has begun to degrade.***

You can view the [interactive graph by itself in your browser here](https://buul-site-graph.vercel.app/), and its [github repo](https://github.com/dnevinrichards01/buul-site-graph) here

### Run locally
1. After cloning the repo, run `npm install`. 
     - this may require you to first install `nvm`
2. Next, run `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser
